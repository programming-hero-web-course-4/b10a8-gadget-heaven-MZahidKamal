## 🔑 React Fundamental Concepts Used

## ✨ 5 Key Features
1. **Product Categories and Filtering**: Users can browse gadgets in various categories such as computers, phones, and smartwatches, and apply filters to narrow down their choices.
2. **Add to Cart and Wishlist**: Users can add products to their shopping cart and wishlist. Notifications via React-Toastify confirm these actions and prevent duplicate entries.
3. **Product Details Page**: Each product has a detailed page showing its specifications, price, and availability, along with options to add to cart or wishlist.
